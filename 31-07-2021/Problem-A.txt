Problem A:

1. SELECT * FROM Project WHERE Pid
   NOT IN
   (SELECT Employee.Pid FROM Employee INNER JOIN Project ON Employee.Pid = Project.Pid);

2. SELECT Eid AS 'Employee ID', Ename AS 'Employee Name' FROM Employee WHERE Pid = (SELECT Pid FROM Employee WHERE Ename = 'ABC') AND Ename != 'ABC';

3. SELECT Pname AS 'Project Name',Pid AS 'Project ID', (Select COUNT(Ename) FROM Employee WHERE Project.Pid = Employee.Pid) AS 'Number of Employee' FROM Project;

4. SELECT Pname AS 'Project Name', (Select COUNT(Ename) FROM Employee WHERE Project.Pid = Employee.Pid) AS 'Number of Employee' FROM Project WHERE (Select COUNT(Ename) FROM Employee WHERE Project.Pid = Employee.Pid) >= 2;

5. SELECT Employee.Ename, Project.Pname FROM Employee INNER JOIN Project ON Employee.Pid = Project.Pid ORDER BY Employee.Ename, Project.Pname;
