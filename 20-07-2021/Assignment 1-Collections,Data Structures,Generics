1. Write a generic method printArray,which takes input of an array and prints each element of the array.
   Print an array of Interger,Double,Character using the same method.

2.Write a program that uses a stack to determine whether a string is a palindrome(i.e string is spelled identically backward and forward).The program should ignore       	spaces and punctuation.

3. Write a program that concatenates two linked list objects of characters.Class ListConcatenate should include a static method concatenate that takes references to both 	list objects as arguments and concatenates the second list to the first list.


4.In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size form top to bottom (i.e., each disk sites on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
3. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.

Write program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
