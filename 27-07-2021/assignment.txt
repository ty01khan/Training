Write the following object  in JSON and XML notations.
		
Company company = new Company();
		company.name = "Beehyv";
company.employees = new Employee[ ];
	Employee e1 = new Employee();
e1.name = “John Doe”
e1.experience = “2 years”
	Employee e2 = new Employee();
e2.name = “Jane Doe”
e2.experience = “3 years”
company.employees.push( e1 );
company.employees.push( e2 );

JSON Notations:
{
	"company":{
		"name":"Beehyv","employees":[
			{"name":"John Doe","experience":"2 years"},
			{"name":"Jane Doe","experience":"3 years"}]
		}
}

XML Notations:
<root>
	<company>
		<employees>
			<element>
				<experience>2 years</experience>
				<name>John Doe</name>
			</element>
			<element>
				<experience>3 years</experience>
				<name>Jane Doe</name>
			</element>
		</employees>
		<name>Beehyv</name>
	</company>
</root>
 
2) Explain the differences between JSON vs. XML?
Ans: XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON. XML has to be parsed with an XML parser while JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

3) There is a way of describing XML data, how?
Ans: XML uses XSL to describe the data.

4) What are XML entities used for?
Ans: Entities define shortcuts to standard text or special characters. XML entities are the way of representing an item of data within an XML document instead of using the data itself.

5)  What is an XML instance document?
Ans: An XML file that contains data is known as an XML instance document.

6)What is JSON? For what is used for?
Ans: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a text format for storing and transporting data. It is used to exchange data to/from a web server.

7) What is serialization and deserialization in JSON?
Ans: Serialization means to convert an object into JSON string, and deserialization means to convert the JSON string to an object.

8) What JS-specific properties are skipped by JSON.stringify method?
Ans: Following JS-specific properties are skipped by JSON.stringify method:
 (i). Symbolic properties.
 (ii). Properties that store undefined.
 (iii). Function properties.
 
9) Explain the difference between JSON and JSONP ?
Ans: JSONP is JSON with padding. 
JSON is stardard format that is human readable used to transmit information from one server to another server.
JSONP is a json with ability to transmit information to another domain. 

10) What is the use of JSON.stringify() function?
Ans: When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string. So, to convert a JavaScript object into a string JSON.stringify() function is used.
